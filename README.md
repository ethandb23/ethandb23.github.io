<p>This app was built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Potential User Stories</h2>

<h2>Development Process and Problem-Solving Strategy</h2>
<p>When developing this app, my main focus was to create a simple, yet fun and user-friendly experience. The development process involved the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Planning and wireframing</li>
  <li>Building the basic structure of the app using React and JavaScript</li>
  <li>Integrating a database of dad jokes to be used in the app</li>
  <li>Styling the app using HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>Testing and debugging</li>
</ul>
<p>My problem-solving strategy involved first identifying the problem, researching potential solutions, and then implementing the solution. If the solution did not work, I would revisit the problem later and try a different approach. I also made use of online resources when necessary.</p>

<h2>Unsolved Problems and Future Iterations</h2>
<p>There are still some areas for improvement in the app. Some unsolved problems that would be fixed in future iterations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improving the styling of the app to make it more visually appealing</li>

  <li>Integrating a search function to allow users to find specific jokes more easily</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Functionality</h2>
<p>One of my favorite features in the app is the ability to randomly generate a dad joke. Every time the "Generate Joke" button is clicked, a new joke is displayed on the screen. This feature adds an element of excitement and unpredictability to the user experience.</p>
